# Foo Bar Finder

## Project Description

The Foo Bar Finder is an application that utilizes a combination of VS Code, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Jquery. The team developed this application that allows the user to pick whether they would like a drink or food recipe at the top of the page. The user will then have the option to either enter an ingredient or choose from a food or drink category. Once the ingredient or a category has been chosen the application will return a random recipe from an API that will contain the ingredient or category the user selected. The user will then be able to click forward and backward through the recipes. When the user finds a recipe they would like to save they have the option to save the recipe and it will be stored in local storage and placed on the left side of the web page. The application calls on two different API's. The API we selected for food recipes is the TheMealDB and the API that returns drink recipes is TheCocktailDB.
